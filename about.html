          I’ve always loved traditional art, but have expanded my passion towards technology based design. Studying interactions between users and their screens has become a great interest to me, and learning to apply the design theories and illustration techniques I’ve previously learned to user interaction has been really eye-opening. It allows me to be hands on in all stages of app designing process from creating screens to illustrating them to prototyping them!<br>

          Expanding my interests is one of the most important things to me, and I’m forever searching to learn new forms to express myself through. I often explore my creative pursuits through experimenting with a vast variety of different aspects of art and design.
